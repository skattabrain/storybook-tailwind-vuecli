    description: `Not many companies do concepts like Lamborghini, and the Terzo Millennio is no exception. Designed in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Terzo Millennio is a look at a future Lamborghini electric car. Each wheel is driven by an integrated electric engine, with power coming from supercapacitors instead of a conventional battery. The supercapacitors will give the system a very long cycle life and the ability to quickly deliver a high peak power. Sensors in the carbon fiber structure are designed to note any cracks or damages, and systems will immediately repair or "self-heal" the vehicle.`,

    description: `The Mercedes-AMG G63 follows on the heels of the new G-Class in January. Like the base G-Class, the car keeps the characteristic slightly-retro styling that has made the G-Class such a classic since its introduction as a civilian car in 1979. The new car is now powered by a 4 liter twin-turbocharged V8 instead of the previous generation's 5.5 liter twin turbocharged V8. In spite of the decreased displacement, output has risen by an additional 14 and 66 lb-ft of torque. It's quicker as well, with a 0-62 mph time of 4.5 seconds, whereas its predecessor took 5.4 seconds to reach the same speed. With all of that power, the engine also offers cylinder deactivation, with the engine running on only 4 cylinders for improved fuel efficiency.`,
